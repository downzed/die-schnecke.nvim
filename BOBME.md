**README for Bob's Note Taking Assistant and Code Explorer**

**Features:**

1. **Note-taking interface**: A chat-like input box for taking notes, accompanied by an output buffer to view your notes.
2. **AI-powered code generation**: Integration with the Ollama AI model to generate code snippets based on your inputs.
3. **Code window management**: Ability to create and open separate windows for different code snippets, allowing you to work on multiple projects simultaneously.

**Todo:**

1. **Context saving & restoring**: Implement a mechanism to save your context (e.g., the current note or code snippet) when switching between windows and restore it when opening a new one.
2. **AI model enhancements**: Expand the AI model's capabilities by adding more features and functionality to its code generation capabilities.
3. **Performance optimization**: Improve the performance of the app when handling large amounts of data, ensuring a seamless user experience.
4. **Text editor window with syntax highlighting**:
 * Create a separate window for text editing (inspired by :) )
 * Include syntax highlighting based on file type or Markdown formatting
 * Open a chat buffer alongside the text editor to discuss the code (another output buffer)
 * Syntax highlight the chat input and output in this new buffer, just like we do with code!
